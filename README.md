# IT6_Finaldrill
This project I have created a CRUD REST API for my SQL database(given by one of my teachers). This API allows users to interact with the database.
I have implemented the CRUD methods so that it can be done in postman.
There is now a search feature that can be done in postman wherein the user can search for an employee using different search queries.
